          We decided on the name 'Mario’' after a brief discussion over the team's name. 
          All of the members agreed on the name. Because of our gaming project that we're all 
          working on related to the legendary Mario game, we feel this is the finest 
          and most reasonable name for everyone.

              This is my second year studying IT at RMIT. I have learnt a number of 
              programming languages from previous semesters such as Python, Java, SQL. 
              Hopefully I can use my knowledge and skills to help my team to achieve 
              any target we plan. Moreover, I can improve my teamwork and presentation 
              skills throughout this project.

              I am a freshman at RMIT University majoring in IT. I would like to improve 
              my IT abilities because I like working with algorithms and data and putting
              what I've learned into practice. In my spare time, I love to listen to music 
              or play video games with my friends. I usually watch youtube videos to help me 
              learn new programming languages such as HTML, Python, SQL. Hopefully, I will 
              breeze through my university years, meet a lot of wonderful friends, and get 
              a lot of important IT knowledge that will help me land my dream career in the long run.

              Everyone can call me Tony for short. My previous major was Marketing, but I soon 
              realized that I didn't really enjoy it, so I switched to IT to broaden my horizons. 
              I've discovered that I love coding and numbers. As a result, I aspire to work as a 
              data scientist in the future. 
              
              I hope to improve my cooperation skills through this project and build networking 
              with others in this course.

              People usually just call me Thong for short, I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city - Vietnam. 
              In my leisure time, I like playing games, sports and spending time with family, so that I can 
              balance my study and health. I started to get interested in technology when I was in the last year 
              of highschool. I think one of my advantages is that I am an open-minded person, so I can network 
              and exchange information with people more easily. This is my first semester studying in university 
              and I may not have much IT experience; however, I believe that I will gain more academic knowledge 
              and skills during university. 
              
              Besides in class, I am studying Python coding from external sources and building some simple programs 
              for practicing and enhancing my skills now.

              I am a first-year student at RMIT University, majoring in information technology. I'd like to develop 
              my IT skills since I enjoy working with algorithms and data, as well as applying what I've learned. 
              I enjoy playing video games with my pals in my spare time. To learn new programming languages like C++ 
              and Python, I usually watch YouTube videos and do some research in IT forums. I also learn from my brother 
              who is studying abroad in the US. Hopefully, I will sail through my university years, making a lot of 
              lovely friends and learning a lot of useful IT skills that will help me land my dream job in the future.

            It truly has little time for our group to manage the project over the remaining five weeks of the semester. 
            For the last five weeks of the semester, there is literally little time for our group to manage the project. 
            However, our teamwork is better than ever due to our good communication skills. The tasks were given to each 
            member with a clear timeline related to each part of the project, so everyone could meet the deadline on time 
            and with the desired quality. Although there were some arguments about the topic of the game project at first, 
            we swiftly addressed these conflicts by analyzing the current situation and delivering the best answer. 
            
            We primarily schedule meetings online due to the long distance among team members. Therefore, we hope that 
            in the future, we will be able to practice teamwork skills through face-to-face meetings in order to avoid 
            unexpected issues related to the Internet connection.

          <div class="info">
            We all have decided to finished and graduated with a bachelor degree in IT, and a clear plan for the future,
            as well as any internship. However, we will be going for different minors in our field. Half of our team
            intended to go for mobile and web development while the other half was to go for Artificial Intelligence.
            Also, all the occupation is going into ways across various regions inside the IT industry, which means all
            the work will contribute to different areas in the IT major.
            Among four members of our group, there is Kiet who is directly interested in game development as a vocation.
            Conversely, Minh’s interest is to become a backend developer so he will have the specialty in working with
            the databases, business logic such as the requirements of the customers and especially the system. Khuong’s
            desired job is become an IT support, he will have the strength in doing the server’s maintenance, configure
            computer systems and diagnose the hardware. Finally, Doanh’s ambition is a web developer, she will be very
            suitable for developing our project since our project was developed on a website platform. Nonetheless, all
            the member’s future job is incompatible, they still have the suitable roles in the project.
            As per our project, for Minh’s specialty, he will be able to build the backend of the game portal such as
            the game server to organize the events and rewards the long-time players. In addition, he will create the
            database of the server to store the user’s information and account, and playtimes of the players. Khuong
            will be suitable with the security and maintenance section of the project since he immersed in the IT
            support position. Doanh’s design talent is very astound so she can build up a perfect frontend of the game
            portal, especially the UI/UX of the game. Ultimately, Kiet will be responsible for the game’s logic since he
            wanted to be a games developer and had the experience about the game programming and additionally, Minh will
            help to create the core of the games together.
